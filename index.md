# Tamagotchi Trainer

### Motivations
In the world today, we see a higher level of obesity than ever before. While this is caused by a multitude of factors, one of the main factors that can be associated with this increase is our lack of exercise. Due to cars and other forms of transportation, people walk far less than before. We want to encourage people to go our walking/running in a fun and engaging way.

### Goals
Our goal is to incorporate an incentive to consistent exercise so that more people will build healthly habits. The effectiveness of this app can be measured in the amount of consistent users of our app. People that open our app everyday are more likely to go out and exercise or are already close to their step count. People say that the hardest part of going to the gym is actully getting in your car, so if we are able to reduce the difficulty of that initial step, we can get more people engaged in a health lifestyle.
