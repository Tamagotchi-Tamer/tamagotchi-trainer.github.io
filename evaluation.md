# Tamagotchi Tamer Usuability Evaluation

## User Goals
* Account Creation/Setup
* Formatting/UI layout on different devices
* Purchasing an Item
* TBD


## Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Registration

Prompt: "Please create an account for the Tamagotchi Tamer application"

This would be the scenario in which we have a completely new user who has just opened the application.
In this scenario, the user is given the login page and asked to register a new account and upon getting to the homepage after registering, asked to edit their user information.

#### Scenario 2: Purchasing an Item

Prompt: "Please buy an item from the shop and apply it to your tamagotchi

In this scenario, the user will be taken through the process of buying an item and applying it to their tamagotchi. Upon finishing the scenario, the user should have a tamagotchi with the given cosmetic on their home screen.

#### Scenario 3: TBD


## User Types
* Older generation (35-60)
  * Most likely to have grown up with tamagotchis and would have nostalgia for the idea
* Late teens to early 20s
  *  Grew up playing mobile games and are both technologically literate and interested in mobile gaming

For the user types, while I think the major categories fall between the older and younger generation, I do believe that the user's familiarity with mobile games should be kept in mind. The way that someone familiar with how mobile games work differs greatly from someone who doesn't play mobile games at all. If this app is to have mass markability, I think considerations should be made to accommodate users both experienced and inexperienced with using mobile apps.


## Recruitment
For the older generation, I can ask my mother and her friends for a few people. They are an ideal user group as they constantly play similar games such as Pokemon Go and other “exercise” games. I also know a few older professors and community members who can test the app and also fall into the inexperienced category of app users.

For the younger generation, I have a few friends that play similar types of games and would be able to give good feedback. I also think it is important to get people who are unfamiliar with these types of games to test the application. For these people, I will ask around my workplace for people who would be interested in testing the application. I also know a few people in the dorms that might be able to test the app.
