## Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Emotional Impact of the Tamagotchi

The user will first be given a login with a normal tamagotchi and asked to explore the application for about 1 minute. 

After that time is up, the user will be asked to login with a separate account which has a sick tamagotchi and will be asked to explore the app for about 1 minute. 

If the user at any point asks about the sick tamagotchi and asks about why it is sick and how to make the tamagotchi recover then this would be considered a success. If they do not mention the change in tamagotchi state, this is considered a failure and feedback will be taken on how to make people notice and care about the sick tamagotchi. Should the user notice the change in the tamagotchi and not care then this will also be considered a failure.

After this test is completed we will have the user provide their thoughts on the sick tamagotchi and if it would motivate them to exercise.


#### Scenario 2: Reading User Fitness Info

Please open your preferred fitness/step app and tell me about the app and how you use it. If they do not have a preferred fitness app, have them open and run through their device's default fitness app.

Once they have gone through their fitness app, the user will them be asked to log into the Tamagotchi Tamer fitness app and be asked to navigate to our fitness section.

Feedback will be taken on what features they most want to use/see in our app that is present in their preferred fitness app.


#### Scenario 3: Assessing Long Term Playability of the Application

In this scenario, we will have the user go to an app of their choice which they have used/played consistently (daily/weekly) for over a month. Once on the app, the user will be asked to walk through their daily routine with the application. 

After they finish, we will then move to the Tamagotchi Tamer app where we will ask questions in regards to features they would like to see implemented in our app. Specifically, we would ask about any features that would keep them invested in our app for more than a month.

Once we go through both their preferred app and the Tamagotchi Tamer app, they will be given the question: "Would you download our app?". Response will then be recorded based off their answer.


## User Types
* Older generation (35-60)
  * Most likely to have grown up with tamagotchis and would have nostalgia for the idea
* Late teens to early 20s
  *  Grew up playing mobile games and are both technologically literate and interested in mobile gaming

For the user types, while I think the major categories fall between the older and younger generation, I do believe that the user's familiarity with mobile games should be kept in mind. The way that someone familiar with how mobile games work differs greatly from someone who doesn't play mobile games at all. If this app is to have mass markability, I think considerations should be made to accommodate users both experienced and inexperienced with using mobile apps.


## Recruitment
For the older generation, I can ask my mother and her friends for a few people. They are an ideal user group as they constantly play similar games such as Pokemon Go and other “exercise” games. I also know a few older professors and community members who can test the app and also fall into the inexperienced category of app users.

For the younger generation, I have a few friends that play similar types of games and would be able to give good feedback. I also think it is important to get people who are unfamiliar with these types of games to test the application. For these people, I will ask around my workplace for people who would be interested in testing the application. I also know a few people in the dorms that might be able to test the app.
