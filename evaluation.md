## Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Tamagotchi States

The user will first be given a login with a normal tamagotchi and asked to explore the application for about 1 minute. 

After that time is up, the user will be asked to login with a separate account which has a sick tamagotchi and will be asked to explore the app for about 1 minute. 

If the user at any point asks about the sick tamagotchi and asks about why it is sick and how to make the tamagotchi recover then this would be considered a success. If they do not mention the change in tamagotchi state, this is considered a failure and feedback will be taken on how to make people notice and care about the sick tamagotchi.


#### Scenario 2: Reading User Fitness Info

Prompt: "Please go to the Fitness tab and tell me about the current user."

After they retrieve the information about the current user, have them go to their chosen fitness app and give me as much information they can tell me from the app. If they do not have a fitness app or do not want to share their data, my personal device can be used as a default test device using the Apple Health app.

Once they have used both, the user will be asked which features they need in the Tamagotchi Tamer fitness page to consider switching from their current app. Feedback will also be taken on their favorite features in their current fitness app.


#### Scenario 3: Purchasing an Item

Prompt: "Please buy your favorite cosmetic from the shop and apply it to your tamagotchi"

In this scenario, the user will be taken through the process of buying an item and applying it to their tamagotchi. Upon finishing the scenario, the user should have a tamagotchi with the given cosmetic on their home screen.

Feedback will be taken on their favorite cosmetic item and if they believe that they like the tamagotchi more or less after applying the cosmetic.


## User Types
* Older generation (35-60)
  * Most likely to have grown up with tamagotchis and would have nostalgia for the idea
* Late teens to early 20s
  *  Grew up playing mobile games and are both technologically literate and interested in mobile gaming

For the user types, while I think the major categories fall between the older and younger generation, I do believe that the user's familiarity with mobile games should be kept in mind. The way that someone familiar with how mobile games work differs greatly from someone who doesn't play mobile games at all. If this app is to have mass markability, I think considerations should be made to accommodate users both experienced and inexperienced with using mobile apps.


## Recruitment
For the older generation, I can ask my mother and her friends for a few people. They are an ideal user group as they constantly play similar games such as Pokemon Go and other “exercise” games. I also know a few older professors and community members who can test the app and also fall into the inexperienced category of app users.

For the younger generation, I have a few friends that play similar types of games and would be able to give good feedback. I also think it is important to get people who are unfamiliar with these types of games to test the application. For these people, I will ask around my workplace for people who would be interested in testing the application. I also know a few people in the dorms that might be able to test the app.
